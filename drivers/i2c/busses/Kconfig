config I2C_GPIO
	tristate "GPIO-based bitbanging I2C"
	depends on GENERIC_GPIO
	select I2C_ALGOBIT
	help
	  This is a very simple bitbanging I2C driver utilizing the
	  arch-neutral GPIO API to control the SCL and SDA lines.

config I2C_AT91
	bool "AT91 I2C Master driver"
	depends on ARCH_AT91

config I2C_IMX
	bool "MPC85xx/MPC5200/i.MX I2C Master driver"
	depends on (ARCH_IMX && !ARCH_IMX1) || ARCH_MPC85XX || ARCH_MPC5200
	help
	  If you say yes to this option, support will be included for many
	  built-in I2C master controllers found in Freescale SoCs. This is true
	  for many i.MX ARM based SoCs, for MPC85xx and MPC5200 PowerPC based
	  SoCs.

config I2C_DESIGNWARE
	bool "Synopsys DesignWare I2C Master driver"
	help
	  If you say yes to this option, support will be included for the
	  Synopsys DesignWare I2C adapter. Only master mode is supported.

config I2C_MV64XXX
	bool "Marvell mv64xxx I2C Controller"
	depends on HAVE_CLK && OFDEVICE
	help
	  If you say yes to this option, support will be included for the
	  built-in I2C interface on the Marvell 64xxx line of host bridges.
	  This driver is also used for Allwinner SoCs I2C controllers.

config I2C_OMAP
	bool "OMAP I2C Master driver"
	depends on ARCH_OMAP

config I2C_TEGRA
	bool "Tegra I2C master driver"
	depends on ARCH_TEGRA

config I2C_VERSATILE
	tristate "ARM Versatile/Realview I2C bus support"
	depends on ARCH_VERSATILE
	select I2C_ALGOBIT
	help
	  Say yes if you want to support the I2C serial bus on ARMs Versatile
	  range of platforms.
